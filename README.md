TODO:
* Add build and usage instructions here;
* Add leader election algorithm, cluster awareness and split brain resolvers (when and if needed);
* Add authentication (should we integrate with morbid?);
* Add 'avoid list' to manage peers we would like to keep out of auto discovery for testing purposes;
* Add unit tests.
